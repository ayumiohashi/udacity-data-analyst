## Red Wine Quality Analysis

Apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables.

### Data

Data is from [Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2009.05.016).

`wine-quality-reds.csv` - Information on red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

Variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1. fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)
2. volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)
3. citric acid (g / dm^3)
4. residual sugar (g / dm^3)
5. chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3
6. free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
7. total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
8. density (g / cm^3)
9. pH
10. sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)
11. alcohol (% by volume)
12. quality (score between 0 and 10)


### Question to answer

Which chemical properties and how are they influence the quality of red wines?
